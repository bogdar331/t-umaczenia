Endless waste
Vsekde niczto
Our patience runs thin
Nasz mir zakonczitl se
Here we stand ready
Vsi my gotovi
Let the battle begin!
Nehaj bitva nastati

Hit back! Charge!
As the forces arrive
Shove! Go! Push!
Leave no foes left alive!

Facing the storm, battered and torn
Burja pr^ed nami, pobity i razdrti
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Bojebahmo za nasz slavny kraj
Come take our hand, together we stand
Grabi nasza ruku, zajedno travamo 
Defending our Glorious Land!
Branimo nasz slavny kraj

Darkness falls
Noczny mrak
And the screams fade away
Obratil kriky w cisziny
Home of the fallen
Dom czto upastli
And the home of the brave!
I dom vseh herojev

Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!
Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!
Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!
